# FreeMart

FreeMart is a **local-first marketplace platform** connecting consumers with nearby product sellers and service providers. Users can search for products/services by location, post AI-assisted requests, receive bids, and manage transactions—all with a single unified account that supports three switchable modes (Consumer, Seller, Service Provider).

## Features

✅ **Unified Account System** — One login, three modes (Consumer, Seller, Provider)  
✅ **GPS-Based Search** — Find nearby sellers and service providers using location  
✅ **AI-Assisted Requests** — Users describe their need; AI suggests title, category, and description  
✅ **Bidding System** — Sellers/providers submit competitive bids on consumer requests  
✅ **Video Content** — Sellers/providers can upload short promotional videos  
✅ **Reviews & Ratings** — Build trust through community feedback  
✅ **USSD Support** — Non-smartphone users can access via USSD menu

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- MySQL 8.0+
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized DB)

### Setup

1. **Run the setup script** (from repo root):
```powershell
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

Or **manually**:

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. **Create `.env` file**:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your database credentials
```

4. **Start MySQL** (requires Docker):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. **Run migrations and seed data**:
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

6. **Start the server**:
```bash
npm run dev    # Development with auto-reload
```

Server runs at **http://localhost:4000**

## API Overview

All endpoints are under `/api/`. Protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>` header.

| Resource | Methods | Auth |

| `/users`, `/profiles` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | Varies |
| `/products` | GET (search), POST, PUT, DELETE | Varies |
| `/services` | GET (nearby), POST, PUT, DELETE | Varies |
| `/requests` | GET (nearby), POST, PUT, DELETE | Varies |
| `/bids` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | Varies |

| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize ORM |
| Database | MySQL 8.0 |
| Auth | JWT (JSON Web Tokens) |
| File Upload | Multer (local storage, S3-ready) |
| Testing | Jest, Supertest |
| Containerization | Docker & Docker Compose |

## Database Schema

Key tables: `users`, `profiles`, `products`, `services`, `requests`, `bids`, `videos`, `reviews`.  
See `db/schema.sql` and migrations in `backend/migrations/` for full details.

## Development

### Running Tests

```

### Running Migrations
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate      # Run all pending migrations
npm run seed         # Seed initial data
```

### Linting
```bash
cd backend

```

## Deployment

### Using Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

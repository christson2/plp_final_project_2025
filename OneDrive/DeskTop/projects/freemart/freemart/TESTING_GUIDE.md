# FreeMart API - Quick Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:4000
✅ Database connected
```

### 2. Test Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/ping
```

Response: `{ "ok": true }`

## 📋 Testing Workflow (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Register User (Consumer)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "phone": "+254712345678",
    "password": "SecurePassword123",
    "account_type": "consumer",
    "address": "123 Main Street, Nairobi"
  }'
```

**Save the returned `token`** - you'll need it for authenticated endpoints.

Example response:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "phone": "+254712345678",
    "account_type": "consumer"
  },
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

**Store token in terminal variable:**
```bash
TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

### Step 2: Register Another User (Provider)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Bob Smith",
    "phone": "+254700987654",
    "password": "ProviderPass123",
    "account_type": "provider",
    "address": "456 Oak Avenue, Nairobi"
  }'
```

Save the response - note the **provider_id** (should be 2)

### Step 3: Create Appointment

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/appointments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider_id": 2,
    "service_id": 1,
    "scheduled_time": "2025-11-25T14:00:00Z",
    "duration_minutes": 90,
    "location": "Consumer office",
    "notes": "Need urgent plumbing repair"
  }'
```

Save the returned **appointment_id** (should be 1)

### Step 4: Get Upcoming Appointments

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/appointments/me/upcoming \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Should return the appointment created in Step 3

### Step 5: Confirm Appointment (Provider Action)

```bash
PROVIDER_TOKEN="<provider_jwt_token_from_step_2>"

curl -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/api/appointments/1/confirm \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROVIDER_TOKEN"
```

Status changes from `pending` to `confirmed`

### Step 6: Mark Appointment Completed

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/api/appointments/1/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROVIDER_TOKEN"
```

Status changes to `completed`

### Step 7: Submit Review/Feedback

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/reviews \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_user_id": 2,
    "appointment_id": 1,
    "rating": 5,
    "comment": "Excellent service! Very professional and timely.",
    "review_type": "appointment"
  }'
```

### Step 8: Get Provider's Average Rating

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/reviews/rating/2
```

Response:
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "average_rating": 5.0,
  "review_count": 1,
  "reviews": [...]
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Could not connect to database"
- Ensure MySQL is running
- Check `.env` file has correct DB credentials
- Run: `docker-compose up` if using Docker

### Error: "JWT token expired"
- Get new token by logging in again
- Update `$TOKEN` variable with new token

### Error: "Forbidden"
- Ensure you're using correct token for the user
- Consumer and Provider need separate tokens

### Error: "Appointment time must be in the future"
- Use a future datetime in ISO format
- Example: `2025-12-25T10:00:00Z`

### Error: "Rating must be between 1 and 5"
- Only submit ratings 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
- Ratings are required fields
